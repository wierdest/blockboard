# BLOCK-BOARD

version: 0.1 alpha as of 07/08/22.

# DESCRIPTION

BLOCK-BOARD is a piece of software that allows the displaying of text attached to shapes in a 3D environment.

The user can MOVE, COLOR, SPLIT & CATEGORIZE the information as needed.

By using the CAT button in conjunction with the PRINT button, the user is able to generate an arbitrary string representation of the board.

Pasting it into a powerful text editor like LibreOffice Writer, a teacher or student may generate any kind of activity they see fit for the presented content.

The current default printed arbitrary string is a color categorization activity.

# THIS REPOSITORY'S GOAL

To be a source for teachers or learners who would like to build the Unity project and modify or contribute to the project.

One extremely interesting aspect of the project to me is the string generation process, in this code base handled by the conventionally named "Printer" class,
available at blockboard/Scripts/Board/Printer.cs.

The reason for that special interest is the fact that such a task is very much on the range of a beginner's scope, when it comes to programming. 

So, a teacher or learner who might think about beginning to learn how to code has the chance of building something of immediate consequence to their teaching or learning process.

The basic intent at the core of this project is that of creating a tool able to interactively display content and generate some text material impromptu. 

The generated material could be used in lieau of workbooks, worksheets or other form of pre-arranged didatic practice. I believe this could result in a more flexible relationship between teachers, learners and the authoritative institutions that regulate the first two's relationship.

Coding provides teachers and learners with the ability to create their own educational tools; to manipulate their own data; to fully reap the profits of their own intellectual work.
